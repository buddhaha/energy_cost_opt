### Here's a brief overview of the EnergyOptimizer class:

- The class constructor takes in the capacity of the solar panel and battery, as well as the minimum and maximum battery levels.
- The measure_power_consumption, measure_solar_production, and measure_spot_price methods are used to set the current values for power consumption, solar panel production, and spot price of electricity, respectively.
- The calculate_cost method calculates the cost of electricity based on the current values of power consumption, solar panel production, and spot price of electricity, and determines whether to use solar power exclusively or buy electricity from the grid.
- The adjust_battery_level method updates the current battery level based on the current values of solar panel production and power consumption, ensuring that the battery level stays within the specified minimum and maximum levels.
- Finally, the optimize_energy_cost method calculates the current energy cost based on the current values of power consumption, solar panel production, and spot price of electricity, and adjusts the battery level accordingly. 
    
You can create an instance of the EnergyOptimizer class and call its methods as follows:

```# Create an instance of the EnergyOptimizer class
optimizer = EnergyOptimizer(solar_panel_capacity=5000, battery_capacity=10000, min_battery_level=2000, max_battery_level=8000)

# Measure the current power consumption, solar panel production, and spot price of electricity
optimizer.measure_power_consumption(3000)
optimizer.measure_solar_production(4000)
```
